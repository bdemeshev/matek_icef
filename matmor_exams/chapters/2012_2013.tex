Marks will be deducted for insufficient explanation within your answers. All problems are mandatory. Sections A and B will make up 60\% and 40\% of the exam grade, respectively. Total duration of the exam is 120 min. \\

\textbf{SECTION A}
\vspace{20pt}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Consider the function $f(x,y)=x^3+y^2+xy-y^5$. Using the total differential find the approximate value of $f(1.01,0.98)$.
\item Consider the function $f(x,y)=x^3+y^2+xy-y^5$ at the point $A=(1,1)$. I have two choices:
\begin{enumerate}
\item move from $A$ in the direction $\vec{l}=(2,1)$ by a small number $\varepsilon$
\item move from $A$ in the direction $\vec{m}=(1,2)$ by $2\varepsilon$
\end{enumerate}
Using the directional derivative find which choice will give me a bigger value of the function $f$ at the destination point.

\item Consider the following system of equations:\\
$\left\{\begin{array}{l}
xyz+2x^3y^3z^3+4x^3=7\\
x+y^3+z^3+xy^3+2x^2z^2=6\\
\end{array}\right.$
\begin{enumerate}
\item Does this system define functions $z(x)$ and $y(x)$ at a point $x=1$, $y=1$, $z=1$?
\item If it's possible find $y'(x)$ and $z'(x)$ at that point
\end{enumerate}

\item Determine whether the following limit exists
\begin{equation} \nonumber
\lim_{x, y\to 0} \frac{x^3+y^3}{x^2+y^2}
\end{equation}

\item Consider the function $g(u)=f(x,y)$, $x=2u$ and $y=u-u^2$. Find $g'(u)$ and $g''(u)$. Assume that $f$ has continuous second partial derivatives at any point.

\item Find the equation of a tangent plane to the surface $z=x+y^2$ at the point $(0,1,1)$.



\end{enumerate}

\vspace{20pt}
\textbf{SECTION B}
\vspace{20pt}

\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item Find all the stationary points of the implicit function $z(x,y)$ given  by the equation $x^2+y^2+z^2+xy+xz+2=4x+3y$.

\item Consider a market with the demand curve $q^d=f(p)$ and the supply curve $q^s=g(p,a)$ where the parameter $a$ describes the available technology. The goal is to find how will the equilibrium price $p^*$ and quantity $q^*$ react to the change of the technology parameter $a$. We assume that  $f'(p)<0$, $\partial g/\partial p>0$ and $\partial g/\partial a>0$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find $dp^*/da$, $dq^*/da$
\item If possible determine the sign of the derivatives $dp^*/da$ and $dq^*/da$.
\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}


\subsection{MFE, fall semester exam, 27.12.2012}

Sections A and B will make up 60\% and 40\% of the exam grade, respectively. Total duration of the exam is 120 min.

\textbf{SECTION A:}
\begin{enumerate}

\item The level curves of a function $f(x,y)$ are shown below. Draw the level curves of the functions $g(x,y)=f(x+1,y)$ and $h(x,y)=f(-x,|y|)$.



\begin{minipage}{0.6\textwidth}

% \begin{tikzpicture}[scale = 0.025]
%  \input{figure/line_curves.tex}
%  \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{center}
\end{minipage}
  


\item Find the local maxima and minima of the function $f(x,y)=x^4+2y^4-xy$. Determine whether the extrema you have found are global or local.

\item Find the gradient of the function $h(x,y)=f(x,y)\cdot g(x,y)$ at the point $A=(1,7)$. It is known that at the point $A$: $\grad f=(1,1)$, $\grad g=(3,3)$, $f(A)=4$, $g(A)=5$.

\item Consider the following system of equations as defining functions $y_1(x_1,x_2)$ and $y_2(x_1,x_2)$
\[
\left\{
\begin{array}{c}
x_1^3+x_1 y_1^3+x_2 y_1 y_2+y_2^3=4 \\
x_2+x_2^3+y_1 y_2^2+y_2^3=4
\end{array}
\right.
\]
\begin{enumerate}
\item If possible find $dy_1$ at the point $(x_1,x_2,y_1,y_2)=(1,1,1,1)$.
\item Find approximately $y_1$ for $x_1=1.01$ and $x_2=0.98$.
\end{enumerate}
\item Find the constrained extrema of the function $f(x,y)=x+2y$ subject to $2x^2+y^2=10$.
%Short run total costs are given by $TC(q,K)=q^2+3qK+4K^2-2K$ where $q$ is the volume of output and $K$ is the amount of capital which is fixed in the short run. In the long run the firm can adapt the amount of $K$ to minimize the costs. Find the long run marginal costs using envelope theorem.

\item Find the Hesse matrix of the function $h(x,y)=\P( Z \in [2x;3y])$ where $Z$ is a standard normal random variable with probability density function given by $f(z)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp(-z^2/2)$. It is supposed that $3y>2x$.

\end{enumerate}

\textbf{SECTION B:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item A firmâ€™s production function is $Q=K+L+2\sqrt{KL}$, where $K>0$ and $L>0$ are capital and labor, respectively. The firm is perfectly competitive and seeks to maximize its output, but the firm is run by accountants who have imposed a fixed budget on the production of $C$ dollars per hour, which means satisfying constraint $wL+rK=C$, where $w$ and $r$ are hourly wage rate and rental rate of capital, respectively.
\begin{enumerate}
\item State the constrained optimization problem associated with that production and solve it by the Lagrange multiplier method (it is sufficient to find the optimal values of capital and labor alone).
\item Check the concavity of the production function and use it to classify the critical point.
\item Explain the economic meaning of the Lagrange multiplier in this problem. Use the appropriate envelope theorem.
\item Let $w=r$. Would it be right to conclude that if the wage rate goes up by 1\% and the rental rate goes down by the same 1\% under the fixed budget the output will not change?  How can you prove this mathematically?
\end{enumerate}

\item It is well known that a perfectly competitive firm operating in the long-run produces at the minimum point of its average costs curve, where $p=AC=MC$. Let the $AC$ curve be U-shaped. If we assume that this particular firm uses only labor, equation $AC(y,w)=MC(y,w)$ may be used to find $y=y(w)$  as an implicit function of wages ($y$ denotes the output). Moreover, the second-order condition that guarantees the profit maximization is supposed to hold.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Show that Implicit Function Theorem can be applied, the function $y=y(w)$ exists and find its derivative.
\item If we know that at long-run equilibrium $\frac{\partial MC}{\partial w}>\frac{\partial AC}{\partial w}$  what can we say about new long-run equilibrium when the market adjusts to a small rise in wage $w$? Will the equilibrium price go up? What about the output of the firm?
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{SECTION A}

\begin{enumerate}
\item A two-product monopoly seeks to maximize its profit. The revenue  follows the formula $R(x,y)=6x-x^2+y-y^2$. The total costs function is given by $C(x,y)=x^2+y^2+4x+3y$, where $x$ and $y$ are the outputs.

State the problem of the monopoly, given condition that its profit $\pi=R-C$ should always remain nonnegative. Apply the Kuhn-Tucker conditions. Use Weierstrass theorem to confirm sufficiency.
\item For any real number $\lambda$, find the minimal value of the objective function $x_1+6x_2+2x_3+4x_4$ subject to the constraints  $\lambda x_1+x_2-x_3+x_4\geq -1$, $x_1+1.5x_2+x_3+x_4 \geq 5$,  all choice variables are nonnegative.

\item Given the Metzler equation of inventory cycles $y_t=3by_{t-1}-2by_{t-2}+N$, where $0<b<1$ and $N$ is a number, find all such values of $b$ for which solution represents convergent stepped time path (the complex roots case). Does the value of $N$ affect your conclusion?
\item Show that Chebyshevâ€™s equation $(1-x^2)y''-xy'+y=0$, where $|x|<1$, can be reduced to equation $\ddot{y}+y=0$ by substituting $x=\cos t$. Hence find the general solution of Chebyshevâ€™s equation.

\item There is an auction of a painting with two players. The value of the painting for the first player is a random variable $v_1$, for the second player --- $v_2$. The random variables $v_1$ and $v_2$ are independent and uniformly distributed from 0 to 1 million dollars. Each player makes the bid $b_i$ knowing only his own value of the painting. The player who makes the highest bid gets the painting and pays the arithmetic mean of the two bids.

Find a Nash equilibrium where each player uses linear strategy of the form $b_i=k\cdot v_i$.

P(W) \left( v_1 - E[(b_1+b_2)/2 \mid W] \right) = \frac{b_1}{k} \left( v_1 - \frac{b_1+0.5b_1}{2}\right)
\]

5 points for stating FOC and 5 points for obtaining strategy from FOC. The final answer is $b_i=\frac{2}{3}v_i$.

You need to solve exactly FIVE problems out of 7. At least ONE problem from each section should be chosen for solving. Each question is worth 20 points.

\vspace{20pt}
\textbf{SECTION A}
\vspace{20pt}

\begin{enumerate}
\item A two-product monopoly seeks to maximize its profit. The revenue follows the formula $R(x,y)=x-x^2+6y-y^2$. The total costs function is given by $C(x,y)=x^2+y^2+3x+4y$, where $x$ and $y$ are the outputs.

State the problem of the monopoly, given condition that its profit $\pi=R-C$ should always remain nonnegative. Apply the Kuhn-Tucker conditions. Use Weierstrass theorem to confirm sufficiency.
\item For any real number $\lambda$, find the minimal value of the objective function $4x_1+2x_2+10x_3+x_4$ subject to the constraints  $x_1+x_2+3x_3+x_4\leq 10$, $-x_1+x_2-2x_3+\lambda x_4 \leq 3$,  all choice variables are nonnegative.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item Solve the system of differential equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
\dot{x}=-x+2y \\
\dot{y}=-x+y
\end{cases}
\]
\item Given the Metzler equation of inventory cycles $y_t=4by_{t-1}-3by_{t-2}+N$, where $0<b<1$ and $N$ is a number, find all such values of $b$ for which solution represents convergent stepped time path (the complex roots case). Does the value of $N$ affect your conclusion?
\item Show that Chebyshevâ€™s equation $(1-x^2)y''-xy'+y=0$, where $|x|<1$, can be reduced to equation $\ddot{y}+y=0$ by substituting $x=\cos t$. Hence find the general solution of Chebyshevâ€™s equation.
\end{enumerate}

\end{tabular}


\item There is an auction of a painting with two players. The value of the painting for the first player is a random variable $v_1$, for the second player --- $v_2$. The random variables $v_1$ and $v_2$ are independent and uniformly distributed from 0 to 1 million dollars. Each player makes the bid $b_i$ knowing only his own value of the painting. The player who makes the highest bid gets the painting and pays the arithmetic mean of the two bids.

Find a Nash equilibrium where each player uses linear strategy of the form $b_i=k\cdot v_i$.
