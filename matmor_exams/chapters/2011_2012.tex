\textbf{Section C}. Solve \textbf{two} of the following \textbf{three} problems

\vspace{12pt}

\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item Find all pure and mixed Nash equilibria in the following bimatrix game:


\begin{tabular}{c|ccc}
 & D & E & F \\
\hline
A & 3;4 & 1;3 & 1;0  \\
B & 2;7 & 3;6 & 0;3  \\

\item Two players play a version of Rock-Paper-Scissor game. Paper beats Rock, Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper. The two players simultaneously make their choice. The first player can choose any object. The second player can choose Rock or Paper. The winner receives 1 rouble from the loser. In case of a draw the wealth of a player does not change.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Construct the payoff matrix of the game.
\item Find all pure and mixed Nash equilibria
\end{enumerate}
\item Two players are trying to bribe the judge. The possible amount of bribe is any real number between 0 and 1 million roubles. The player who gives the biggest bribe is announced as the winner of the affair by the judge. The winner receives 1 million roubles. The loser gets nothing. Obviously bribes are not returned by the judge. In the case of equal bribes each player gets nothing.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Are there any pure Nash equilibria in this game?
\item Find at least one mixed Nash equilibrium.
\end{enumerate}

Short tips:
\begin{enumerate}
\item No
\item If the second player choses his move according continuous distribution function $F$ then the expected payoff of the first player for the bribe $b$ is equal to
\[
1\cdot P(b_2 \leq b) - b = 1\cdot F(b)-b
\]

If a rational player uses mixed strategies he is indifferend between the corresponding pure strategies. That means that $F(b)-b=const$ for pure strategies that are mixed. For pure strategies that are mixed the density function $f(b)=F'(b)=1$. Do I know such a random variable? Yes, I know! A uniform on $[0;1]$.
