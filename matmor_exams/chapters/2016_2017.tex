\subsection{MFE, fall exam, 2016-12-27, solutions}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item 
  \item Let's bound the sequence from both sides:
  \[
    0 \leq \frac{x^2 y^2}{x^2 + 3y^8} \leq \frac{x^2 y^2}{x^2} = y^2
  \]
  So the limit is equal to $0$.
  \item 
  \item 
  \item Just look at first $B_1$, $B_2$ and $B_3$! $B_1 = (-1/1 ; 2/1)$, $B_2 = (-1/2; 3/2)$, $B_3 = (-1/3; 4;3)$.
  We see that only points from $[0;1]$ belongs to every $B_i$, so $A = \cap_i B_i = [0;1]$.
  The set $A$ is bounded, closed, compact, convex. The set $A \times A$ is a square on a plane.
